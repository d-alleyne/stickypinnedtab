## Sticky Pinned Tab
Sticky Pinned Tab maintains a tab's _pinned_ property when moved between windows. This brings a feature found in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) to Firefox users.

### Motivation

Moving a pinned tab between Firefox windows causes it to be unpinned. On researching possible solutions I found [Bug 1505014](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1505014) which is marked as *wontfix*.

This extension is my solution for users that wish Bug 1505014 was fixed.
