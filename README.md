## Sticky Pinned Tab
Sticky Pinned Tab is an attempt to mimic Google Chrome's Pinned Tab behavior in Firefox.

### Motivation
Firefox's current pinned tab behavior is marked as _wontfix_ in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1505014), but a few Chrome users would prefer
if Firefox's pinned tab behaviour mimicked Google Chrome's. This is my attempt to help those users with the transition.
